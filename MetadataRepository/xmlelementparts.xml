    XmlElementPartsh  Collects tokens for XML analysis

  <Description>
    Module Operations 
  
  This module defines an XmlParts class  Its instances build a sequence 
  of tokens obtained from the Tokenizer module for analysis of XML
  XmlElementParts are lists of tokens that terminate on one of the tokens
   or 

  This structure is designed to collect just the right amount of inform
  ation from an XML file for analysis  That is it collects the smallest
  set of tokens that lead to the detection of grammatical constructs 
  without having to save part of the sequence for later use or get more
  to complete the detection process  This simplifies the design of code
  analysis tools

  Note that assignment and copying of XmlParts instances is supported using
  the default operations provided by the C language  Copies and assignments
  result in both source and target XmlParts instances sharing the same toker
