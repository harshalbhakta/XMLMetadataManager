    Module Operations 
  
  This module defines a tokenizer class  Its instances read words from 
  an attached file or string  Word boundaries occur when a character sequence
  read from the file or string
   changes between any of the character types alphanumeric punctuator
    or white space
   certain characters are treated as single character tokens eg 
            and n
    You can change the selection with TokersetModeTokercode or
    TokersetModeTokerxml or TokersetSingleCharTokenssomestring
   Tokercode is the default tokenizing mode
   Double quoted and single quoted strings are returned as single tokens
    You can turn off collecting single quoted strings as tokens by calling
    TokerreturnSingleQuotedStringsAsTokensfalse  That is needed if 
    you are parsing text with single quotes as possessives for example
  A tokenizer is an important part of a scanner used to read and interpret
  source code or XML

  Public Interface
  
  Toker t                         create tokenizer instance
  returnComments                request comments return as tokens
  iftattachsomeFileName       select file for tokenizing
    string tok  tgetTok       extract first token
  int numLines  tlines        return number of lines encountered
  tlines                     reset line count

  Maintenance History
  
  ver    Feb 
   TA Mehmet Kaya fixed bug handling many contiguous escape chars
    reported by Ider Jian Zhang and Harshal Bhakta
  ver    Feb 
   added returnSingleQuotedStringAsTokenbool doReturn to support
    XML parsing where text body has single quotes  Note that if you
    set as false then single quoted attribute values wont be returned
    as a single token
  ver    Jan 
   made putbackint a public rather than private member function
  ver    Jan 
   added TokersetSingleTokenCharssomestring
   added notes about setMode and setSingleTokenChars to Manual
    and Maintenance information
  ver    Jan 
   added Tokermode either code or xml
   changed container for single char token ids from vectorchar
    to string
   added test for end of file in isTokEnd to fix bug found by
    Jim DelloStritto that sometimes caused Toker to fail returning
    last character if not a singleCharToken
  ver    Feb 
   fixed bug in braceCount to eliminate changing count when brace
    is in a quoted string or comment
  ver    Feb 
   fixed bug in eat comment that hung on ending comment with no
    newline by testing for stream state good
  ver    Feb 
   added stream closing to destructor and attach memeber functions
  ver    Feb 
   added if test at end of getTok to avoid returning space after 
    C comment as a token
  ver    Jan 
   first release
