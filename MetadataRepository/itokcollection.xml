    ITokCollectionh  package for the ITokCollection interface    
  </Title>
  <Description>
    Module Purpose
  
  ITokCollection is an interface that supports substitution of different
  types of scanners for parsing  In this solution we illustrate that
  by binding two different types of collections SemiExp and XmlParts
  to this interface  This is illustrated in the test stubs for the
  SemiExpression and XmlElementParts modules

  Note that we only use the SemiExpression collector in the parser and
  all of the higher level executives  We certainly could bind the 
  XmlParts class to parsers ITokCollector pointer but didnt due to
  lack of time
